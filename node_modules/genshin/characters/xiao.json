    "description": "One of the 'Mighty and Illuminated Adepti' guarding Liyue, also heralded as the 'Guardian yaksha.' Despite his appearance as a young man, occasional legends about him have been documented in ancient books for thousands of years. He is especially fond of Wangshu Inn's Almond Tofu.
