    "description": "Liyue's sole rock 'n' roll musician. She rebels against ossified prejudices using her music and passionate singing. Xinyan's performances can get so intense that her impromptu stage is set ablaze, often burning the surroundings. Xinyan insists that these pyrotechnics are the apex of performative art, and that they are physical phenomena that have nothing to do with her Vision.",
